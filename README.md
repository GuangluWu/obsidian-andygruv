# obsidian_andygruv

This is an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme combined and modified from two existing themes: [obsidian_gruvbox](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox) and [Comfort-Coda](https://github.com/nickmilo/Comfort-Coda). 

---
### Main improvements:
- Using the color scheme of [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
- [Andy_Matuschak mode](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) with notes stacked unlimited along the horizontal direction.
- Minimise the spare and useless space between notes.
- Most of the vertical scrollbars are hidden.
- Add a non-transparent background to the graphview mode, so that it won't be distracted from the layer below.
- The side bars are hidden when not being used.

### Known issues:
- Currently, not working well with horizontal notes. But it is fun to try it.
